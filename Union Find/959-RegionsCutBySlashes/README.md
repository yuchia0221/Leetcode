### [Solution](/Union%20Find/305-NumberofIslandsII/solution.py): Disjoint Set

Time Complexity: ![O(n^2*a(n))](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;O(n^2&space;\alpha&space;(n))>), Space Complexity: ![O(n^2)](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;O(n^2)>), where n is the length of grid and $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse ackermann function, which grows slowly.
