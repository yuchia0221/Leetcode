### [Solution](/Union%20Find/990-SatisfiabilityofEqualityEquations/solution.py): Disjoint Set

Time Complexity: ![O(m*a(|\Sigma|))](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;O(m\cdot&space;\alpha&space;(|\Sigma|))>), Space Complexity: ![O(nm)](<https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\inline&space;O(nm)>), where m is the length of equations, $\alpha(\cdot)$ is the inverse ackermann function, which grows slowly, and $|\Sigma|$ is the alphabet size.
